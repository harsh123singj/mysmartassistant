                    <h5>7. AI and Machine Learning Use</h5>
                    <p>
                        AIVO DocAI incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) functionalities
                        to enhance user experience, streamline document management, and enable intelligent retrieval and
                        summarisation of documents. These technologies are designed and deployed in a privacy-conscious
                        manner, with clear user control, opt-in preferences, and strict data governance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>7.1 Nature and Scope of AI Processing</strong><br>
                        The App leverages AI models to perform the following actions:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Natural Language Query Interpretation: Users may retrieve stored documents by typing or speaking
                        natural language instructions (e.g., "show my electricity bill for April 2023"). Our AI engine
                        interprets such commands to identify and surface the most relevant file from your stored
                        documents.<br><br>

                        Document Classification: When enabled by the user, AIVO DocAI uses machine learning techniques
                        to automatically assign categories to your uploaded documents (e.g., "utility bill", "identity
                        proof", "property document"). This helps improve the accuracy and speed of future
                        searches.<br><br>

                        Document Summarisation: Upon user request and explicit opt-in, the App may summarise the
                        contents of lengthy documents using AI summarisation tools. This feature is purely optional and
                        under user control.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        No AI/ML processing occurs without your knowledge or consent. You can toggle AI summarisation or
                        classification features on or off at any time through your account settings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>7.2 User Consent and Controls</strong><br>
                        AIVO ensures that AI functionality involving classification and summarisation is only activated
                        when you have explicitly opted in. By default, these features are disabled for new users. Users
                        can:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Enable or disable AI-powered features via in-app settings<br>
                        Revoke previously granted consent at any time<br>
                        Access logs or summaries generated by the AI (where available)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We do not use AI to make decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects for users
                        (as defined under Article 22 of GDPR).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>7.3 Data Inputs and Outputs</strong><br>
                        All inputs used by the AI engine (such as documents, queries, and metadata) are securely
                        encrypted during processing. Outputs generated by the AI (including classification tags or
                        summaries) are linked only to your private account and are not shared externally or used to
                        train future models.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        AIVO maintains strict zero-knowledge processing principles, meaning that no AIVO employee or
                        system has access to the content or AI results associated with your account in an unencrypted,
                        readable format.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>7.4 No Profiling or Behavioural Tracking</strong><br>
                        AIVO DocAI does not use AI to profile users, build behavioural models, or infer personal
                        characteristics for advertising, marketing, or commercial exploitation. We do not conduct
                        automated decision-making based on AI outputs that affect your rights, employment, legal status,
                        or access to credit or benefits.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>7.5 Data Minimisation and Privacy by Design</strong><br>
                        All AI features have been developed with a privacy-by-design approach, ensuring:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Minimal data retention (only what is required to support functionality)<br>
                        Clear data lifecycle controls (automatic deletion of cached results)<br>
                        End-to-end encryption of user inputs and outputs<br>
                        Localised inference wherever possible to reduce cloud dependency
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We do not use your personal data or documents to train or improve global AI models, and all
                        processing is session-specific and confined to your account environment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>7.6 AI Model Transparency and Auditability</strong><br>
                        To ensure accountability, we maintain technical logs and audit trails of AI interactions where
                        necessary. This includes:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Timestamped queries<br>
                        Processing status (success/failure)<br>
                        AI version used
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These logs do not contain content or documents themselves and are retained only for security and
                        debugging purposes.
                    </p>

                    <h5>8. Access Permissions</h5>
